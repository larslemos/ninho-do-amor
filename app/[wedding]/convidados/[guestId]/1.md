1. Use Prettier
   Ensure all files are formatted with Prettier (consistent indent, spacing, trailing commas, quotes, etc.).
   Add a .prettierrc or use your repo’s Prettier config if present.
   Run npx prettier --write . on all new/changed files.

2. Follow Your Folder Structure

Place pages under /src/pages
Place components under /src/components
Place hooks under /src/hooks
Place data and utility files under /src/data and /src/lib
Avoid duplicating folders (e.g., avoid /app/convites/src/pages if your repo uses /src/pages)
Move files from app/convites/ into the main /src structure.

3. Hooks Usage
   Use custom hooks for shared logic (e.g., useToast, useIsMobile).
   Use hooks for state management, effects, and data fetching.
   Avoid logic in components that could be abstracted into hooks.

4. Component Composition

Break large components into smaller, reusable ones (e.g., split preview, form, and settings panels).
Use props for data flow and callbacks (onUpdate, onChange, etc.).
Prefer function components and React.FC with TypeScript types for props.

5. TypeScript Best Practices

Always use TypeScript (.tsx, .ts).
Define explicit types for props and state (e.g., interface, type).
Use types from your repo’s /src/types (e.g., CasalData, ConviteDesign).
Avoid using any; prefer specific types or generics.
Recommended Actions for Your PR Files
File Moves
Move all files from /app/convites/src/ to /src/ and adjust imports.
Example: /app/convites/src/pages/Create.tsx → /src/pages/Create.tsx
File Formatting
Run Prettier on all .tsx and .ts files.
Code Structure
Check large components (like Create) and split UI logic into smaller child components if possible.
Ensure each custom hook is under /src/hooks and used in components where logic is shared.
TypeScript
Verify all files use TypeScript and have explicit interfaces/types for props.
Use types already defined in /src/types for all data models and props.

Example Adjustments
Before:

TSX
import React, { useState } from 'react';
// ...
const Index = () => { ... }
export default Index;
After:

TSX
import { FC, useState } from "react";
// ...
const Index: FC = () => { ... }
export default Index;
Props Interface Example:

TSX
interface CoupleFormProps {
onDataChange: (data: Partial<CasalData>) => void;
onNext: () => void;
data: Partial<CasalData>;
}
Next Steps
Move and rename files as per your repo’s /src structure.
Run Prettier.
Check TypeScript strictness.
Break up oversized components.
Use and organize hooks.
If you want, I can generate a checklist or show a refactored example of a specific file. Just tell me which file you want to see first!
